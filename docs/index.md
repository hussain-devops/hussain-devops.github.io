## Master's thesis project

#### NLP for aiding Scientific Literature Curation (April 2019 - August 2019)
The huge amount of information in the Scientific research literature has presented us with a challenge of curating, integrating and summarizing it into a structured data model, that can be used for various meta analyses and to provide a brief summary snapshot of any given scientific area. This project aimed to develop an application that uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) based approaches to mine documents from scientific literature, process and extract relevant information, organize the information into a structured form and provide a summarization to help researchers by reducing the time for manual curation. This application processes the bulk literature documents provided by the user, performs analysis and provides summary of them, among other things.
