This project aimed to develop an application that uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) based approaches to mine documents from scientific literature, process and extract relevant information, organize the information into a structured form and provide a summarization to help researchers by reducing the time for manual curation. This application processes the bulk literature documents provided by the user, performs analysis and provides summary of them, among other things.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#imdad-hussain","text":"","title":"Imdad Hussain"},{"location":"#devops-engineer","text":"","title":"DevOps Engineer"},{"location":"#hussaindevops12gmailcom","text":"LinkedIn","title":"hussain.devops12@gmail.com"},{"location":"#about-me","text":"6+ years of experience in IT industry working across multiple teams as a DevOps Engineer Experience working on Linux based environments hosted across On-premise and Cloud Infrastructure (ICP, GCP,AWS) Implemented solutions for DevSecOps including security scanning as part of build pipeline using SAST, DAST and NexusIQ Worked on IBM Websphere Liberty, containerization using Docker and orchestration with Rancher, Kubernetes","title":"About Me"},{"location":"#work-experience","text":"","title":"Work Experience"},{"location":"#wipro-digital-lloyds-banking-group-fal-team-platform-engineer","text":"","title":"Wipro Digital (Lloyds Banking Group): FAL Team -
